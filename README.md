# CardFlip

My friend sent me this question:
"So there are some cards, say N cards. I have arranged those N cards in a straight line with some of them face up and some face down. And now I tell you to choose any face up card at random and flip it, and immediately flip the card to it's right. It doesn't matter whether the card to the rightis face up or down. 
So I tell you to keep doing this. Now the question is will this sequence of flipping ever end or go on forever?"

So I made this app to make it easier to visualise the answer.
